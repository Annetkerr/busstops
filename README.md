# Rosario City Bus Stops
An example of Jupyter Notebook, using pandas, ipywidgets, and folium to display maps.
Based on what I learned in the Python for Data Science course at the University of California - San Diego, on the edx.org platform.

## Contents
In the notebook you will see how to acquire the data from a csv file, the further process to adapt it to the requirements of the project.
Some optimizations are made to make the response speed more agile, using a dictionary along with a Pandas's DataFrame.
In the map the markers are shown indicating the corners of each stop of the routes of the different bus lines that are chosen with a dropdown list widget, and with HTML an explanatory legend is added to the map.
